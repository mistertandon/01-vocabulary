Hi, I'm Aron Warner.
I'm one of the producers on the film.

Hi, I'm Vicky Jenson.
I'm one of the directors on the film.

And I'm Andrew Adamson,
the other director on the film.

If you're watching this,
you're probably one of those people

that tikes people sitting behind you
in the movies talking,

so it's your own fault
that you have to listen to us

for the next hour and a half. We won't kick your chair, though.

Now, this is actually the opening
of the movie,

which is usually the bit at the start,

and we actually were looking for
a very classic kind of fairytale opening,

and we actually ended up...
We have these brainstorming sessions

where we all sit around a table
and try and come up with ideas,

and we came to this conclusion
of wanting to open, like,

a traditional fairytale
and having a storybook,

and I think it was Aron...

I think all the ideas in this movie
were Aron's.

Pretty much.

I love the graphics of that book.
Julia Woolf was one of our artists

in the department,
and she was just wonderful.

I love that book.

At one point we thought about having
the DreamWorks logo

on the front of the outhouse,

'cause, actually,
that half-moon just seems so perfect,

but, well, we got voted down.

I still like the idea.
See, we're kind of close.

And this is actually...

This whole sequence was actually
quite an effects-intensive sequence.

It had some of, actually,
the most difficult things

right at the start of the movie.
Mud, water.

Yeah, I think in the additional material,

you'll probably see some
of the effects guys

wearing a yellow sticker,
pouring mud over each other,

just to see how it looks
when you take a shower in mud.

Actually, all the difficult things, mud,
water and nudity, were in this sequence.

Yes. His bits and pieces
are nicely hidden, <i>à la</i> Austin Powers.

We also had a number
of our effects artists

jumping into a swimming pool,
which was a lot of fun to watch.

But they didn't fart, though. They didn't poot.

I gotta say,
when we screened this film in Cannes,

in competition
at the Cannes film festival,

as soon as Shrek jumped in the water
and farted,

I know I put my head in my hands.
I think we all did.

Here we are sitting in tuxedoes
and evening gowns,

wearing borrowed jewels,

and everyone's watching Shrek
take a poot in the water.

Did you ever give those back,
by the way? The jewels?

No one lent me any jewels. Yeah, me neither.

I had a bodyguard watching me,

so I had to get rid of the jewels
at the end of the night.

They were a little gaudy, anyway.

Took the outfit into, kind of,
an Eva Gabor direction.

I love the eyeball scene.
It was fun, actually. This was important,

to establish Shrek not only as an ogre
who didn't want anybody

hanging around his swamp,

and eating gross stuff,
but you had to like him,

so it was fun to watch him
just have fun with his day.

I think, actually, this was one

of the more difficult sequences
because of that.

We wanted to say so much
and just really do it in a music sequence

where we weren't really stopping
to explain things too much,

but we wanted to set up the fact
that Shrek is a fun-loving ogre

when he's kind of living by himself.

Remember, we used to kick out
all kinds of characters from this swamp,

because Shrek, he doesn't like anybody.

He was scaring away
Little Red Riding Hood

and Mary and her little lamb.

That's me. "All right, let's get it."
That's Sim. He's our editor.

We have voices popping up
all over the place from our crew.

Those ogre hunters were
so hard to light, weren't they?

Now, this from Mike Myers
was actually a lot of improv.

He was really, really great.

We'd give him an idea
of where we were heading,

and we wanted Shrek to come up
with all these different gross things,

and we just gave him a list
of 50 or so gross things

that everybody had come up with,

and he took those
and then just added to that.

Added 50 more. We had to edit it down.

There were some hilarious things
in there.

Here's the very technically-difficult spit. Yes, we fought a lot for the spit.

It's just the right amount of clumpiness.

Andrew's right, though.
This sequence was really difficult

in terms of getting across who Shrek is.

Does he like his life?
Does he not like his life?

Does he like people?
Does he not like people?

And I think we came up
with a really good balance.

Also, the generic characters.

We had originally designed
these characters

to be more background elements.

We hadn't had any sort of
principal foreground humans

other than Princess Fiona. Right.

But when we reworked the sequence

and wanted to have
these ogre hunters in there,

we had to really do a lot of work
on the characters,

to make them be able to stand up
to that kind of inspection.

This sequence is one of those examples

of how many times
we storyboarded ideas,

trying to find the right way to go.

Back in the days
when Shrek wanted to be a knight,

that was one of our original stories,
he rescued Donkey from a witch.

He found her caravan.

We had all this backstory
on how Donkey could talk.

And the witch just came down
to being this little old lady here.

These fairytale creatures
provided a lot of fun for us.

When we sort of came up with them
for the story,

it was really a matter
of just sitting down in a room,

again, doing those
brainstorming sessions

we were talking about before,
where a bunch of us would sit around,

story artists, producers, writers,
directors and so on,

and just say, "Okay, everyone come up
with three funny ideas"

"for fairytale creatures,"

and this is one of those sequences
that had a lot of those ideas in it.

The voice of the captain there
is one of these guys

that's just worked on everything,

all kinds of animated cartoons,
usually on TV.

Jim Cummings. He was just great.

Our story guys
make a lot of cameo appearances.

That was Cody as Pinocchio

and Chris Miller as his dad,
as Geppetto, selling Pinocchio.

This was so funny.
That actress was great.

And those three pigs back there
are Cody as well.

They're all Cody, yeah. Yeah.

Eddie was so amazing.

This is the first time we hear him
really speak in the movie,

and he was so funny.
The way he could just take any line

and present it in a way
that we never expected,

but it was always funnier
than we expected.

He was incredible.

You'd kind of go
and you'd pitch him a sequence,

you'd show him the pages and so on.
He'd read it very quietly, just to himself,

and then he'd just step in front
of the microphone and just...

Bam! He's just instantly this donkey.

Turn it on completely. Just completely turn it on.

Come out with stuff
we'd never, ever imagined.

Just take a single-beat joke
and turn it into a three-beat joke.

Sequences got longer
because his jokes were so good.

That's our <i>Star Wars</i> shot. Yeah.

And that was our butt shot. You always have to have a butt shot.

"Little donkey."
What did Mike always say?

"Wee Donkey." "Sweet little Donkey."

"Aye." The accent.

Yes. This is the Scottish ogre,
of course.

We did experiment with a number
of different voices for Shrek.

He was Scottish, then he was Canadian.

Canadian... He went back to Scottish.

Kind of a south country kind of guy
for a while.

The thing with Mike is, he's somebody
who can really create a character,

and I think this was
particularly good for him

'cause he got to create a character

without having to go through
five hours of makeup every day.

But we went in with him
and did what we usually do with actors,

which is kind of record the character
with their real voice.

Our characters
are already very caricatured,

somewhat cartoonish, and you don't
want the voices not to seem real,

so that's kind of what we did with Mike.

We just got him to use his real voice,
but then when he saw it,

he really sort of thought
he could give it something more

and wanted to go back into the studio,
and he very generously gave

a couple of weeks
just to go into the studio

and develop the character.

And we had previously had a scene
of him reading a letter to his father,

and Mike had automatically done that
in a Scottish voice,

and we'd responded to it

very well at the time. Yeah, that's right.

So we kind of went back to that.

We ended up with this idea
that Shrek's parents were Scottish

and they moved to Duloc,
and he was brought up there,

so he's kind of, like,
second-generation Dulocian.

Back in the days, again,
when Shrek used to want to be a knight,

there was a sequence
where he was trying to tell his parents

that he wanted to go out in the world
and become a knight,

and his father was saying,
"Ogres can't be knights!"

And at that point
it was Andrew and me as the parents!

Doing atrocious Scottish accents.

And it was welcome,

because it connected Mike
to the character of Shrek

and gave him the freedom to do
what he wanted to do with the part,

which I think really shows.

This was one
of the first sequences we animated.

It was very early. It was actually
the first really naturalistic sequence

that we did, too,
as far as the forest and the trees

and all that kind of thing.

We actually went backwards
and forwards.

At one point it looked too natural,
and we wanted to keep it stylized,

keep it like a fairytale storybook
come to life.

So the grass is more green
than you'd expect.

Didn't we change the order
of this sequence a number of times?

No, it actually was Ogres and Onions
that followed this one,

'cause this is where they meet,
and then Ogres and Onions,

where they're walking through
the cornfield

and Shrek is describing what ogres are

and how similar they are to onions,
used to follow this,

but it felt like they became friends
very quickly,

and we picked that one up
and moved that one till after Duloc.

We also felt like
we wanted to make sure

we introduced Donkey
as early as possible.

We changed the order.

We had a kind of repetition before
where Shrek was...

We were kind of saying who Shrek was,
and then later on he ran into Donkey,

and this scene kind of
did the same thing,

which really kind of explained
who Shrek was

and what his issues were
about people rejecting him

and him rejecting them first.

It was actually a great moment
that we had

when we realized
that we could put this scene here

and really get across the point
of who he was

and introduce Donkey earlier. Yeah.

I remember we all jumped out
of the bathtub

and ran through the streets naked
yelling, "Eureka!"

It was quite a moment
for everybody involved, actually.

I don't remember it
that way exactly, but...

Nothing but a shower cap.
This sequence is fun.

It has this line
where Donkey runs around on his chair

and talks about what they're gonna do
in the morning,

and it's one of those things
that kids have picked up.

Oh, my God. I've heard so many kids
say that that's their favorite line.

"In the morning
I'm gonna make waffles."

In Mexico, "I'm gonna make tamales."
In France, "I'm gonna make crepes."

Everybody loves that line.

In England,
it's probably bangers and mash.

It's probably a good point to mention
the amazing facial animation on <i>Shrek.</i>

We were really lucky
to get the whole <i>Antz</i> crew

after their experience on that film
and coming as far as they did,

not only with the technology
of the facial system,

but the amazing artistry,
and having to push it further

now that we had, sort of,
more human faces.

Shrek, certainly, and of course, Fiona.

It was just stunning how warm
and how subtle the acting can be.

I love that little bit of animation
of Donkey.

That's one of the cutest little pieces. "Sweet Donkey."

But no, Vicky's right. They developed,
really, a very advanced muscular system

for the faces that really simulated
anatomically-correct muscles,

so that they could actually do
very subtle expressions,

and eyes and eyebrows.

You'll notice when the creatures frown,
when the characters frown,

there's the little frown lines
between the eyes.

There's wrinkles around the eyes.

When their mouths open, their lips
actually stick together very slightly.

It's a very advanced system.

They're all actors.

Yeah, exactly. And they're tremendous actors,

and they did an incredible job

of getting into the heart and soul
of the characters themselves.

This is a good point to mention
the gorgeous music

that Harry Gregson-Williams
and John Powell did on this film.

This theme of Shrek's, I just love it.

Same with the opening of the film,
which is actually Fiona's theme,

'cause, as we're flipping the storybook,

it feels like we're gonna tell the story
of a very classic fairytale,

and it's actually Fiona's theme
we're hearing.

But this one's just beautiful.
It's sweet, but it's not sentimental.

Actually, back there was one
of the most redone and redone effects,

which was Shrek pulling the earwax out.

Right.

I wanted to have the level of grossness
without going too far.

We had a couple
of really over-the-edge earwax shots.

Yes, we did.

Actually, Fiona's theme,
mentioning that,

was at one stage Shrek's theme.

Harry and John were working with it,

and they played it to us,
and we were like, "You know what?"

"It just seems a little too traditional
for Shrek."

And so I think they were
a little bit downhearted about that,

'cause they really liked the theme,
and then the next time we saw them,

they played it again and said,
"Welcome to Fiona's theme!"

Yeah, and it worked. It worked great. These were some classic voices.

The voice of Simon Smith,

our layout supervisor,
as one of the mice.

That was Chris Knights,
the assistant editor.

And Mike Myers
as one of the mice as well.

This scene really changed things for us
when we figured out

that if we brought
all the fairytale creatures into his land

and got him out that way,

that it would be much more fun
and successful

than the other methods we had.

At one point we had him burnt out
of his house.

That was! That was Aron!

At one stage we used to have Shrek
burnt out of his house.

Lord Farquaad was trying
to beautify the kingdom,

and he sent a bunch of soldiers
to burn Shrek out of his house,

which was very dramatic,
but not particularly funny.

So when we developed
these 2,000 cute fairytale characters

to be Shrek's motivation for leaving,

it just opened up
a huge amount of comic fodder,

we'd like to call it. I love that gag of the witches landing,

and the elves helping
like airport attendants.

So, back there you should notice
that there were only two bears.

There was just Papa Bear
and Baby Bear.

You have to keep an eye out. Just remember that.

We'll bring that up later on. Most people get it.

I'm telling you,
even little kids have told me.

This was a scene
where I was saying to the directors,

"This is really expensive.
We can't do all these creatures."

And they were telling me,
"We'll do it in the dark

"and you can just see their eyes." Sure! I don't think that was us that said that.

I don't know who it was,
but I'm not that naive, okay?

It was probably the most expensive,
in terms of render time,

with all of these characters, all the fire,
all the fur, the leaves, the moonlight.

Something like nine hours
to render one frame.

People may be asking,
"Why are the pigs German?"

And we'd have to answer,
"We have no idea."

We have no idea. It was funnier.

Except "huffed and puffed"
just sounded funnier.

Than "huffed and puffed."

Eddie was great here. Yeah.

Here's a loop line.

The loop line in there
always stands out to me.

Right here.
"Attention, all fairytale creatures."

That was recorded in a car, wasn't it?
That one "fairytale creatures"?

I think we went back
and picked it up again.

For a while there... The car didn't work.

That's right. Jeffrey went to New York
with a little DAT recorder

and recorded it
in the back of a car with Mike,

but unfortunately the driver had forgotten
to turn off the radio.

The radio was on, so we had to redo it.

It still stands out to me.
I know it blends, but I still hear it.

And Jeffrey's
gonna keep his day job, I think.

I love the flower cape. I don't know.

It's just one
of those classic fairytale gags

that, you know, the hero gets draped
by flowers from the birds,

but Shrek doesn't like it.

At one point we had a lot more
of Donkey singing in the movie,

singing song after song after song,

and I guess when even we found
it annoying, we cut back a little bit.

It was hard for Eddie to sing this badly.
We had to specifically say,

"Can you sing this worse,
please, Eddie?"

This intro to Farquaad was so much fun.

You know, design-wise, we always
kept Farquaad's castle very angular.

See how the glass has got angles to it?
We didn't want anything soft or round,

'cause that was sort of Shrek's thing,
everything organic.

This was fun. In storyboard,

it was pitched
that Farquaad was introduced

kind of like Darth Vader
stomping through the Death Star.

I've gotta say, when Conrad
first pitched this sequence,

I don't ever remember laughing so hard.

I saw tears coming out of Aron's eyes.

Conrad Vernon,
that's the storyboard artist,

and the voice of gingerbread. And the voice of gingerbread man.

You can buy the toy
and hear Conrad saying,

"Not my buttons!" Buttons, not buns.

We did discover...
This was the first sequence

we animated with John Lithgow, right? Yes.

We couldn't get his big voice to
feel right coming out of that little guy,

and we had to go back a few times
to figure out how to do it,

make sure that his breaths
were really big,

and that he moved
to support that big voice.

Yeah, threw the head around. He could launch, in the body,

to launch that huge voice
out of that little frame.

The sound guys were always
grabbing the knobs

when John would go into the speech,

'cause his voice could go
from a really insidious whisper

to this booming, Shakespearean,
addressing voice. It was incredible.

I love the facial animation
in this sequence, too.

You really get to see the wrinkles in
the forehead and how well that works,

and then just the expressions that
the animators have used are just great.

I mean, Farquaad,

they actually have it to the point
where he looks psychotic.

I mean, he's got this sort of gleam
in his eye that doesn't feel...

It feels like he's disconnected
with what he's thinking about.

One of the things
we really found which...

Duh. It's one of the most
obvious things, probably,

but with the eyes being
the window to the soul kind of thing,

and the fact that you really look
at people's eyes when they're talking,

that's really where most
of the important animation happens,

and it's little eye darts, small changes
in the shape of the eyelids.

If you look one way,
if you look away for a moment,

everything really changes
very subtly in the eyes,

and that's kind of what the difference is
between a character looking alive or not.

We'd quite often be saying,
"Add a blink here,"

or, "Do a little glance here,"
or, "Look from one eye to the other."

It just makes all the difference. This was one of those sequences

that really sets the type of humor
that we did.

Sometimes we'd do
these comedy passes.

Part of the way through production

we'd get other directors together
from DreamWorks and sit around

and look at the movie
kind of like we are now

and just say, "Okay, I've got a joke!"

And everyone adds ideas
as they think of them, and that's where

<i>The Dating Game</i> parody came out of. What was this before?

It was just kind of a slideshow

where he was presenting
a bunch of different women.

It didn't have the whole
<i>Dating Game</i> feel to it.

And it was a natural,
with the Magic Mirror becoming a TV.

And once again,
we actually have the voice

of a storyboard artist, Chris Miller,
being the voice of the Magic Mirror here.

You know, we make the whole movie
in storyboard a couple of times.

Well, many, many times.

More than a couple of times,
in this case.

And we record with ourselves
and the story people.

We do a lot of scratch dialogue,

and in some cases, you get so attached
to the sound of the scratch dialogue.

It's so funny. You can't do it better.

We did record the Mirror
with a few other actors,

and we just kept coming back to Chris.
He's so funny.

And our Thelonious, the executioner,
is Chris Knights,

who was the assistant editor. And also one of the mice.

And one of the mice.
And funny that we kept it.

It actually... We really made this movie
in Aron's garage.

It was just a bunch of people
who got together one afternoon

and did the voices
and made the movie in the garage.

I don't have a garage.

I love <i>The Piña Colada Song</i>
coming in here. It just slays me.

The first time it was pitched and Conrad
started singing that song, I just died.

I don't know if it was
<i>The Piña Colada Song</i>

or Conrad singing
that was particularly funny.

A combination of the two.

There's a little bit of animation
on Farquaad coming up here

where he lifts his eyebrow
and grits his teeth. It's so cool.

Raman was amazing,
our supervising animator.

Raman Hui and his team
did an incredible job,

and that was one of the first little...
Of those subtle expressions,

I think, with Farquaad, that he animated.
It's just incredible.

This sequence was another one that
went through incredible permutations,

the introduction of Duloc
and Farquaad's sterile environment.

What he was doing to Duloc

he was planning to do
to the rest of the kingdom.

We looked at a lot of different things
for Duloc.

They went up to Hearst Castle.

We looked at a lot of, kind of,
Albert Speer architecture.

We ended up coming up with this thing
that was basically a fascist theme park.

Listen carefully. That's Andrew.

See? I can do it on call. That's very good. Okay, do it again.

That was actually what I was saying
through most of the movie.

Every time Jeffrey asked us
to do anything, it was just like...

This sequence was the final version
that combined all the best stuff.

It was boarded by Eric Darnell,
one of the animators...

One of the directors, sorry, from <i>Antz,</i>
along with Catherine Yuh.

He came up with the gag of...

What are those... The "Welcome to Duloc."

Yeah, the "Welcome to Duloc,"
and the little dolls singing.

When we were looking
for a manufactured reality,

as I said, we went to Hearst Castle.
We actually came to Universal City.

We also looked into Las Vegas,

but that was just an excuse
to try and get to Las Vegas.

It would never appeal to families.

I love this doll sequence. It's so fun.
It is a spoof of...

We could sing it.

<i>Duloc's such a happy place</i>

I'll leave Vicky hanging out there
singing by herself!

It was fun. It was great.

The little dolls are so cute.
They're designed by Julia Woolf, again.

She was the best at coming up
with our little Duloc graphics.

The signs hanging over
all the different shops.

The art department
just did amazing research

and beautiful work all through the movie,
but in Duloc, we had a lot of fun.

I think painting the walls
to that perfect, sterile white,

and painting the flowers
to the pink color.

You can see examples of it
in the background,

I think a little earlier than these shots,
but part of Duloc is still being renovated.

James Hegedus,
our production designer,

has had a lot of experience
in both visual effects and live action,

and he had this wonderful sense of,
sort of, fantasy storybook

that he managed to sort of incorporate
into this whole 3-D world,

and actually was really, really good
with all the lighting.

We had a very stylized lighting scheme
that we wanted to use,

kind of almost
an Impressionistic palette.

We have very warm light
and cool shadows,

and it's very enhanced, very heightened,

and it was very difficult
for the lighters to actually achieve.

They had to work very hard
to do something

that was behaving in a photo-real way,
with true lighting and shadow,

but then also was very enhanced
and stylized in its colorization,

and I know it was a very difficult thing
for them all the way through.

There's been all kinds of great ad-libs
from Mike throughout here.

When they're coming
through the tunnel, when he says,

"All right, you're going the right way
for a smacked bottom,"

it was something he recorded
in-between takes.

I think he was actually
reprimanding Andrew.

I know. We thought it was really funny,
and we found a place to slip it in.

This was one of those sequences, too.
We've always had a tournament,

and it was a little more traditional
with Shrek taking out the...

Jousting and horseback-riding
and the whole bit.

One of our animators came up
with the idea to make it more like

a World Federation Wrestling
kind of thing,

and we just all collectively
slapped our foreheads with a "duh!"

We were a little ways down the line
with this sequence

when that idea came around,
and we just said,

"Okay, it's totally worth going back
and making it work that way."

That little bit of hockey
was in tribute to Mike Myers.

Yes.

And the mud and water here,
that was actually,

for its brief moment onscreen,

probably one of the more scientifically
difficult effects we had ever done.

Absolutely.

PDI had developed a water system
for use on <i>Antz,</i> so of course we said,

"Well, now we want to use beer,
mud and everything mixed together,"

so they had to extend it even further.

Those crowds are fun.
They're like mix-and-match people.

Mr. Potato Head people.

You can pick features and hair
and clothing color,

and the guys mixed them all together
to come up with these crowds.

But it's so funny,
even in computer animation,

no one likes to do crowds.
They hate it in traditional animation.

It's just too much to draw,
too much to control,

and it doesn't change in computer.
It's just as painstaking.

I hate that one woman in pink. Yeah, I don't like her either.

With her big jaw? She was also very difficult to work with.

Yes, she was terrible. She wouldn't come out of her trailer.

She always did that same movement
of just holding her arms in the air

and just jerking her body back and forth.
I didn't like that.

I love this, the <i>Gladiator</i> shot.

That's one benefit
of working on a movie for so long,

is that you get to keep adding gags
and little tributes.

Referring to all the films
that have come out

in the three years
you were working on this one.

That was fun, too.
Those are all crossbows,

but we needed to have a sound cue

that made you realize
that Shrek was in danger,

so it was the sound
of cocking pistols and rifles, but...

By the way, there are no arrows
in those crossbows.

No, there are, they added them! Did they get added?

Yes, they did them partway through.
I didn't notice that

until I was actually checking a frame
of film and arrows showed up, so...

We have these things called CBBs,
which is "Could Be Better..."

Which in my book means,
"Never will get done."

Which means, "Done. Move on." Yeah.

But we had a CBB on the fact

that somebody hadn't put any arrows
in the crossbows,

and we just thought,
"Well, no one will notice."

And then somebody actually went back
and put the arrows in.

That's awesome.

This deal here
between Farquaad and Shrek.

There used to be an entire sequence
about this, boarded hundreds of times.

The two of them walking through
a garden making the deal,

because actually,
when you think about it,

having Farquaad as fastidious
and small as he is

and Shrek as huge
and slovenly as he is,

putting the two of them together

just seemed like
it would be ripe for comedy.

There was
a whole dinner sequence, and...

And a fantastic performance
from John Lithgow.

With the deal.
We used to have this one scene...

One of the many versions of the deal
was when they came in

and Farquaad showed Shrek a model
of the world-to-be,

his vision of Duloc, and he had
this wonderful rant, which was just

an incredible performance from John. "It will be a Duloc world after all!"

This is the very first sequence
we animated,

the first one that went into production,
and it got rerecorded a couple of times.

And actually reanimated
a number of times.

We found that after
we'd gone a bit further

and the animators really got
a hang of the animation system

and Shrek and his face
and how it worked,

when we came back
and watched the sequence,

it looked like Shrek had just been in
for dental work.

It had that kind of
numb-lower-lip kind of feel.

And in truth it was good.
The animation was still good,

but it wasn't up
to how much everyone had grown

over the course of the film.
We did that with Fiona also.

Yeah.

You know, you learn a lot
about the characters along the way.

What can they do, what can't they do,
what looks good, what doesn't,

what sells an emotion,
and you come back and fix it,

which is the great thing
about this process.

Donkey is so fun in this sequence.

This is the one
where Andrew was talking about...

He took one line
and turned it into a three-beat joke.

This bit at the end
about parfaits and tissues.

Great acting from Raman here again.

The other thing I love
about this sequence

is the willingness
that the effects artists had

to just go in and go that extra mile
and put in the little details

that you would often think
you don't need,

but just help cue you into a reality.
They help make this world believable.

Even though it's not our world,
it's as believable as our world,

and it's little things

like noticing the petals on the flowers
blowing in the wind.

The flies buzzing. Which I've gotta say,

to people who don't know a lot
about this process,

it's one of the things that really
stands out for them in this film,

is this sequence and the sunflowers. Right.

I've had a number of people
say that to me.

Because...
You know, we didn't even think about it,

'cause we did it way back when, but... Yeah.

And just even having wind blowing
in the trees and things like that.

It's one of those things you don't notice,
but you expect it,

and if it's not there,
then you notice its absence,

and that's when you lose
the suspension of disbelief,

and it was very important
to maintain that.

Yeah, little puffs of dust
when they're walking along.

This was funny.

Because of the issue with the princess
becoming an ogre at night,

we had to make sure this sequence
felt like it was daytime,

so we had to go back in and add
daylight poking through those clouds,

'cause we had this big, ominous
circle of clouds over the volcano,

but when it was real dense,
it felt like we were already in nighttime,

so it defeated, or at least diluted,
the issue of the princess.

So hopefully you're not silly enough
to actually watch it the first time

with the director commentary,
or else we just ruined the story for you.

And if you did, then you deserve it.

Then stop now,
go back and watch the movie properly.

This is the second scene we animated,
and it was, as you'll see in a second,

so hard that pretty much everyone
wanted to quit after it,

but we convinced them to stay. I know I wanted to.

Wait. There's a joke coming up here
we tried so many things for.

We ended up coming back
to the original.

No one could come up
with a better joke.

"But look at the location!"

It kills me! Slays me every time. Sorry.

Lava. There used to be
a parking lot of skeletons

from previous knights' horses.

They'd parked them out front,
gone in to rescue the princess,

never came back,
and the horses just died there.

We thought it was funny at the time,
but ultimately, it just didn't look right.

At one point, this sequence
was in another place in the movie, too,

and their relationship
wasn't as advanced,

and actually, it felt like Shrek
was much too mean to Donkey,

and we came back
and kind of moved it around.

We managed
to find a performance in there

that supported him not being so mean.
Because it's not about him being mean,

it's about him
using Donkey's own insecurities

to get him to cross the bridge.

Which is actually kind of
how we made the movie.

We just used our own insecurities
to try and get us through it.

For a while, it felt like this sequence
was just always so overproduced.

Like, what's going on?
They're just crossing a bridge.

But in a way, it really develops
their character, their relationship.

The effects artists did a wonderful job
with this lava, too.

Again, anything that you see
in the movie that's fluid or very organic

is actually some
of the most difficult stuff to do,

and involves a lot
of very heavy computation,

a lot of very complex formulas

to figure out
how these things work and move,

and they did an amazing job
with all of those things.

This sequence is also a good example
of the idea of using cameras

in a more real way in this movie.
Obviously, in computer animation,

you can put that camera
anywhere you want,

move it perfectly in line
with the characters

as they're walking along,
but in this case,

we really wanted, kind of,
a handheld feel,

and have the cameras behave in a way
that the audience is used to seeing

in traditional live-action films,
and that sequence was really effective,

with the camera swinging out
over the bridge.

You really feel like
you're on the bridge with them.

This was one of the first sequences

where we actually really allowed black
to be a major part of the palette.

We kind of made this commitment,
as I said before,

to a very heightened
kind of lighting system,

and had limited our shadows,
or keeping our shadows full of light.

And because we wanted
a very different mood inside the castle,

we allowed this one now to have
sort of black in it for the first time.

It was one of the nice things about
working in animation, working in CG,

is you design every element
that's in there,

which gives you the freedom

to completely play
with the environments

to create a mood,

and this is one where we wanted
to create a very different mood

and just limit the palette
to black, red and blue.

That's not dissimilar
to what a cinematographer

and a production designer
would do together in a live-action film.

Right. As the sequence goes on,
once the Dragon comes in,

we actually wanted to get more
and more stylized with the lighting.

We referenced things like <i>Cinderella,</i>

where the sisters are pulling her dress
and ripping her dress,

and she can't go to the ball,

and the background started to drop out
to just red.

There's also an Orson Welles film,
<i>Touch of Evil,</i>

where there was a murder scene where,
as the lights flashed on and off,

the sequence became
more and more simplified,

and in our case,
once the Dragon shows up,

the environment does fill up with smoke,
but it goes more and more red,

and the details of the background
start to drop out.

The fire.
Andrew, you gotta talk about the fire.

Again, it's organic in its nature,

and because of that
was very difficult to achieve.

Very often, computer-generated fire
tends to have either a very soft quality

or a very hard-edged quality,

and we had
to really come up with something

that behaved more like real fire
but we had complete control over,

'cause we wanted to use it, obviously,

as the Dragon's
main defense mechanism here.

His little tail is smoking.

This was really scary
at one point for kids,

when the music was even bigger
and more dramatic,

but John Powell was amazing.

He took it a bit more heroic
and a little more positive,

and you realize
that nobody's gonna get that badly hurt,

and the kids kind of get over it.

Plus, when they see that Dragon
falls in love with Donkey, it's okay.

There's also, there,
a very nice storytelling shortcut.

Let's just throw Shrek into the room
so he doesn't have to find her.

It's so convenient. It worked.

I love this part. Poor
Donkey. Little thing.

There she is.

One of the challenging things,
actually, in this part of the sequence

was all the smoke and atmosphere.
Again, that's sort of volumetric stuff

that's very difficult to do in CG and very
computational, and was really quite a...

Difficult to say. Difficult to say as well, yeah.

But it was a real challenge
to build up this density in the air

as the smoke and fire
and everything kicked up.

But we really wanted to give it
a softer look in general,

to make it feel like another world

and not the traditional,
hard-edged CG look.

Really fun acting on the Dragon, too,
which was a real difficult trick

with her being so big
and her texture so evident, but...

And not particularly vocal.

Fairly limited facial animation setup
for the Dragon,

but we got to do a lot of good things
with her.

A great tail swing on her. Her voice was difficult, too.

We ended up going through
a lot of different panthers

and leopards and dogs,

and Hans Zimmer, the composer,
actually brought his dog into the studio

and left him there to whine. To whine for us.

This was another one of those moments

where we hit on the humor
early on in storyboard,

with Princess Fiona laying down
to pretend to be asleep

and pucker her lips in preparation
for the kiss from her Prince Charming.

That was first pitched
from Catherine Yuh in the storyboard.

It was sort of like,
"That's it! That's amazing!"

"That's the tone of the movie!"

I do remember, too, this was
the first animation we did with Fiona,

and the first time we saw her
get up from the bed,

I think we all practically
ran out of the room screaming,

'cause it just didn't look quite right! That's right. It was pretty scary.

The design, even, of Fiona
was very scary.

I mean, Tom Hester,
our lead character designer,

had built most of these characters
in clay

before we took them into the computer,
and there's a bit of a difference

between the translation
from clay to computer, we found.

She was much more stylized
at one stage

with big and more anime eyes
and so on,

and she just looked like this freaked-out
ant-mannequin creature.

Just very scary. Yeah. It did not work.

Very tiny waist.

Cameron was really fun to work with,

and we'd do recordings with her,
and she would just go and go and go.

She had more endurance than we did.

She was amazing.

She really wanted to
get into the physicality

of the princess running down the stairs,

and she had Cody, one of our story guys
who was reading lines with her,

grab her arm and pull her

so that she could sound
like she was being pulled by Shrek.

I thought he was gonna pull her arm out.

Which Cody was only too happy to do.

He had a great joke,
'cause his last name is Cameron.

We got him to do this finally after
a year and a half of recording with her.

"Cody, go ahead. Tell her your joke!" "Do your joke, Cody. Perform!"

And he goes,
"Cameron, if you married me,"

"you'd be Cameron Cameron."

So there's a cookbook back there.
What does it say?

<i>Tasty Treats: How to Prepare a Knight.</i> Yeah.

It's the Dragon's cookbook
for cooking knights.

The art department, again,
was amazing,

coming up with this kitchen,
this Dragon's kitchen.

Yeah, and everyone was really good.

The level of detail
that we wanted to push things to

and the level of detail that
the art department pushed things to,

and then the level of detail
that the effects animators,

the lighters,
and the animators went to...

Speaking of lighting,
this one was really funny,

because we always wanted it
to feel like, kind of, a disco boudoir.

This was the great
Dragon seduction scene.

We even had music playing
at one point.

At one stage, we had
<i>Love to Love You Baby</i> in there,

and for a while we had <i>Puppy Love</i>
played on the harp.

In a lot of ways,
the lighters have it the worst,

because there's so many iterations,

and it's the end of the line,
so things have to look right.

So it's back and forth
and back and forth with the directors

to make this perfect, make this right,
and they never gave up,

and they just did an incredible job. Some great slow-mo coming up.

The temp track we had
was sort of a <i>James Bond</i> thing

done by the Propellerheads,
and it had this great energy about it,

and the composers...
I think we really tortured them.

They kept the flavor of it,

but still working
with Shrek's heroic theme.

Yes, and they did really great
with this piece of music.

Wonderful. Yeah.

This is where we really wanted
to play with, kind of,

a live-action action-sequence feel,

which is why we started playing around
with the camera speeds

and just really shooting it more
like this was kind of a live-action movie.

There's that extra-long column
that they could slide down.

That column
would be three times longer

than any other column in that room,

but we needed it to be like that
so they could slide down it.

Very sophisticated humor there. This one's funny, too,

because it was storyboarded
by Dave Lowery,

who's storyboarded
for Steven Spielberg quite a bit,

along with Simon Wells,
the director from <i>Prince of Egypt,</i>

and if you look at this gag,
it is kind of a classic cartoon gag

of characters running
in and out of corridors,

kind of popping up
where you don't expect them to,

but it worked really great,
to drag that chain...

It's a really long chain. Very long chain.

Didn't we refer to that overhead shot
as the <i>Scooby-Doo</i> shot?

Yeah, I think so. I think in my presence you didn't.

I think I did in your presence.

Another cool slow-motion. I love this shot.

Yeah, I love this shot, too.

Simon Smith, our layout supervisor,
had a lot of fun with this sequence.

And they all come up to speed
as they're running. Very exciting.

The first time
we put this sequence together,

everyone just was floored. Again, the fire there is incredible.

It was not only the balls of fire
that we'd already had,

but we wanted the fire
to actually be burning the bridge,

so they had to make fire

that kind of tracked along
physical objects and so on.

The end of this sequence,
when they all escape

and the Dragon is caught
at the end here,

Steven Spielberg actually suggested
we add a shot

where she sits like a puppy dog,
kind of pining away for Donkey,

and it really helped you remember her
for when she comes...

First we kind of said,
"Steven, what does he know?"

Yeah, exactly. Yeah. "This is our movie!"

You know,
"What are you talking about?"

It's so great to be able to get
that kind of expert opinion

on the work you're doing,
and it always helped us along the way.

It was incredible.
It was being at film school.

With Professor Spielberg
and Professor Katzenberg.

This is the first sequence
we actually animated

the whole sequence with Fiona,
and because of that,

even though
it's a relatively simple sequence,

no big effects,
relatively simple lighting environments,

it was probably
the most difficult sequence to light.

It was the one where we really had
to figure out how Fiona's skin worked,

how these complementary shadows
that we were doing worked on her,

because, when we went
to the same level

that we'd been
on some of the other sequences,

she looked very dead.
Her skin went too blue or too cold.

She kind of looked dead.

So this was very challenging
for Philippe and his team of lighters.

Yeah. Acting-wise, too.

We actually went back
and reanimated her.

At one point
we treated her a bit more balletically,

more theatrical, because she was
pretending to be this princess...

But it ended up looking
like a bad high-school play,

and we had to pull her way back into,
sort of, human proportions.

Exactly.

This one coming up is so much fun,
when the two of them laugh.

Again, just really fun animation.

The little drag there on Donkey's mouth
when he says, "Shrek."

His jaw and everything in there
is fantastic.

I love this. He falls over.

The animators looked a lot, actually,
at dogs for reference for Donkey.

They looked at donkeys as well,
of course,

but donkeys
aren't particularly expressive.

They're not that expressive.
Funnily enough...

So, they studied dogs a lot.

This is beautiful in her... That's not very nice.

She just looks exquisite there.
I love Shrek in his sooty makeup.

Yeah, his expression is beautiful.

That's my favorite
Shrek facial expression.

That was Fred, wasn't it? Yeah.

Yeah. Great animation. This, too.

Every animator
had to do every character.

It was not like a traditional film,
where you have a lead

on each character. Right.

Each one of our team
actually had to animate

whatever character appeared
in their sequence. It's funny.

Donkey proved to be a little bit easier
and a little more fun in some cases,

'cause of the four legs
and the expressive eyes,

and you could go as far
as you wanted with him.

Fiona, a little trickier,

because we all know
how humans are supposed to move,

and any time
she did something too extreme,

or lifted an eyebrow too far,
it would just look funny,

so we just beat up the animators
whenever they had Fiona scenes.

It was also fun 'cause we had
a variety of different animators,

but we had
a largely male animation staff...

Yeah. And we had to get them all up

and walking around like a woman,
so that was kind of interesting.

Some of them, the first time through,

she had a real good hip swing going
at times.

A little too far. A little too far.

I love this transition
to the next sequence,

where she's screaming and pounding
and then bored, hanging there all day.

It works really well, to be able

to spread the characters around
to all the animators,

because you get to learn a lot more
about the characters that way.

They don't get stale.

They grow as the film grows
and as the animators take them on.

This has beautiful lighting.
This very late day,

late in the afternoon sequence
just looks so great on the characters.

It's a funny little thing coming up here,

where Shrek and Donkey
make fun of Farquaad's height,

but we never actually have them
meet Farquaad face to face.

They have no idea how tall he was.
It was left over from earlier versions

where there was the dinner
and the deal,

and Shrek was actually face to face
with Farquaad. If you look back,

you'll see that Farquaad
was up in his podium the whole time.

But since you know he's short, it works. It works fine. You don't question it.

This actually was a sequence

where we had probably about
six or seven height jokes in there.

We had to trim it down, 'cause it just
seemed like it went on and on.

This is beautiful on her. I love this.

And again, we wanted to start planting
the seeds of suspicion about Fiona.

Why does the sunset bother her?

What's she so concerned about?
But without hitting it over the head.

And also that there's something
unexpected about her,

like the way she screams at them
and frightens them.

I love this facial expression here. Great facial expression.

And just cut to the cave.

And when we were working
on the sequence,

we kind of treated the sun almost like
a fourth actor in the scene

that, compositionally,
it just had to play enough of a part

that we realized
that there was some significance

to the sun going down
that was affecting Fiona.

Her superhuman strength.

Another great expression coming up
from Shrek here.

You look up at him and...
That's very cute.

See, you just sit here
and enjoy it with us.

We'll all just go, "Look at that face!" What is Donkey implying?

I love that. It is so unexpected.

We worked pretty hard
at the end of that little bit

to make that joke land.
We tried a lot of different things,

and in the end it was just,
"Leave it be, it's funny."

Another lovely piece of music here.

We used a lot of different things
on the temp,

but John and Harry just wrote
such a lovely piece of score for here.

I love Donkey on his back. He's so cute.

The little stretch that he does
coming up,

when they're looking at the sky,
is so sweet.

No shortage of scatological humor
in this movie.

No, it was very important. Very key,

very thematic. We're very sophisticated.

It's the stuff that people take for granted
that still gets me.

The wrinkles in the clothes
in Shrek's tunic and in Fiona's dress,

it's stuff that just seems so automatic,

and adds
to your suspension of disbelief,

but is actually
a big pain in the butt to do,

and, you know, our character TDs,

the people who set up the characters
and set up the clothing,

came up with, pretty much,
automated systems

that did a lot of the clothing
deformations, a lot of the wrinkling,

and then we had a clothing group
to do all the rest of it.

Shrek's, the bottom of his tunic,
is basically set up separately

from the top of his tunic,
as is the bottom of Fiona's dress.

So, often during
the course of production,

the characters are half-naked until... That's right.

Most of this sequence...
Most of these sequences

we saw Fiona in green leotards. And Shrek's plaid butt.

You don't want to put that skirt through
simulation till her animation is finished.

I love this sequence
where you pop around.

Donkey just appears one side
and then the other.

He sort of developed this magical way
of moving around that we just buy.

But we didn't do it often.
We did it selectively.

And there's Fiona,
and if you look very carefully,

you can see that there's something up
with Fiona here,

but we just tried to keep her kind of
in the half-light, half in the shadows,

and really play with the lighting,

so it's kind of one of those things where,
if you go back and look at it,

you go, "Of course.
She was a beast at that time."

"She was an ogress."

But when you watch it
the first time through,

hopefully... You don't see it.

You're not obsessed with that
and it doesn't distract from the scene.

'Cause her eyes are big
and her eyebrows are thin.

You'll see her close-up right there.

That's the beast Fiona,
not our regular Fiona,

but we put a warm light on her
to kind of camouflage the green skin,

but we didn't want
to cheat her that much

and make it
the beautiful princess in there.

It had to be the beast to work.

Between Guillaume Aretos,
one of the art directors,

and Susan Hayden,
one of the sequence supervisors,

that shot went on for a good year. Probably about a year.

This is lovely,
the two of them against the moon.

One of the things in this movie is,

we really wanted to have a number
of quiet moments,

just moments that really allowed
the audience to sit back

and sort of think about
what's been going on,

and it was really nice
to be able to do that.

In an animated movie,
where every frame is so deliberate,

sometimes the temptation
is to really make it move the story along,

move the story along,
so we really kind of wanted

to keep some of those quiet bits. You had to have it to get to know Shrek.

Okay, so now, earlier on
we were talking about Mama Bear,

and for those of you who didn't
really click to what that is, well...

There she is. There's Mama Bear.

No! She's a bearskin rug!

There's actually a wealth of visual gags
in here, throughout his bachelor pad.

Originally that painting behind him
was Farquaad on the half-shell,

kind of like Venus on the half-shell.

I love this sequence, only because
for a long time I was singing it,

and it was a very exciting day for me

when we first showed it
to Steven Spielberg and I realized,

"He's gonna hear me sing!" "That's me singing!"

But it's not me singing any more.

This was actually a joke
that Aron originally came up with

for the love montage sequence,

but we ended up doing that sequence
as a musical number.

The love montage comes later on
in the movie, you'll see it,

where they blow up the balloons
and they have a day together.

But then we have the Eels song playing. We had an Eels song playing,

so it didn't work anymore,
and for a while it wasn't in the movie,

and then we decided
we needed a moment with Fiona alone,

a chance to kind of get to know her...

I'm gonna stop for a minute. Let's enjoy this together.

A chance to get to know her and see her
having a little moment by herself,

being a typical fairytale princess.

But not. But not quite.

But not. Exactly. But then, she's an opportunist.

And then we got to layer the joke,
one thing on another and another,

so she blew up the bird,
and then we thought,

"Well, she's doing
something nice, really,"

"because she's making breakfast
for Shrek."

It's funny layers because she's upset
about blowing up the bird,

and you see the eggs, and you think

she's gonna be concerned
for the baby birds,

but then she makes use of them,
very productive use of them.

I love that little Donkey line here. Yeah, me, too.

When he wakes up. It's so funny. That was a lot bluer at one point.

We had to tone that one down.

There's great acting from Shrek here,
too, after she walks away.

"We're going to have a big day,
aren't we?"

And they mug to each other like,
"Wow, what is she thinking of?"

Then Donkey licks his lips.

Yeah, the thought of Donkey
eating eggs, for some...

It really grosses you out!

It's a little mad cow disease
for my liking.

There's the face. This is so fun.
This is actually Cameron belching.

She got an award for this
on Nickelodeon.

That first belch, I believe, is Sim,
our editor, being Shrek belching.

But that's Cameron!

And she didn't record that for the scene.
We actually got that one for free.

Cameron is amazing.
She's such a wonderful, down-to-earth,

just very real person,

and she's so perfect for the princess
in that way.

As you know, she's this person

who lives this glamorous
Hollywood lifestyle.

She's a supermodel, she's an actress,

and she's just a really very real person. Totally normal and fun to be around.

Which is very like our princess.

She's this very down-to-earth person
who believes she has to play this role.

It's Vincent Cassel
in a cameo appearance as Robert Hood.

He's so funny.

This actually was, also, another one
that was a bit bluer.

Our story artist, Conrad, again,

found all these horrible pickup lines
on the Internet,

where he was approaching Fiona
and saying,

"Did it hurt?" "What?"
"When you fell from heaven."

It was really horrible. It went too far.

It was funny because it was icky,
and then after a while it was just icky.

And here we get to do
a classic musical number.

Just for a bit, though.
Like the other classical numbers,

we always stop it
with something abrupt.

Boy, the Riverdance thing is so fun.

We just decided to mix together
in the sequence

as many parodies as we possibly could. That's basically what it is.

For a while this seemed
so out of context with the movie, too,

'cause there's such a departure

that suddenly we're in the middle
of a musical number,

but once it was all sort of designed,

and they did a beautiful job
with the location

so it kind of blended in,
it worked really well.

And bam! There she comes. Plus, it's a Fiona moment.

We started out with a very Jackie Chan
kind of thing here.

That was initially our inspiration.

We went back and looked at a lot
of Jackie Chan movies for her.

And then while we were working
on the movie,

which took a fair amount of time,

there were a number of other movies
that came out.

Obviously <i>The Matrix,</i>

which is featured very shortly. Coming up right here.

That's a Jackie Chan thing. That's a Jackie Chan thing.

Just before finishing the sequence,

<i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>
came out,

so were able to make
a little parody of that,

adding the very enhanced
sound effects...

Right here? Let's listen together. And this triple-kick coming up here.

Yeah. Super cool.

There's a great little bit on Fiona
where she blushes in a moment.

Aron, you thought of that idea,
didn't you?

No. That she should blush?

Actually, all this forest is lovely.

We wanted a very, sort of,
naturalistic forest here,

and we wanted to give it an overall,
kind of, green palette,

and Janet, the lighting supervisor
on this sequence,

did just an amazing job of capturing
that soft light,

the shafts of light
filtering through the trees.

I love the red bushes.

Henrik did a great painting for this
sequence that had a beautiful palette

of these greens, grays
and the red bushes,

and it was just wonderful
to see it captured in lighting.

An example of Donkey
popping around again.

Look at the size of his head!

We had this challenge
all the way through,

because Fiona's head is so petite,

and Donkey and Shrek
have such an enormous head,

or enormous heads, each. Yeah.

And at one stage,
when we have a romantic scene,

and Shrek is actually
almost gonna kiss Fiona,

it was kind of like, "Oh, my God,

"he could just bite your head off!" "He's gonna eat her."

I think this scene was also
originally boarded by Tim Johnson,

or written by Tim Johnson... That's right.

One of the directors of <i>Antz.</i>
Helped us out a lot along the way.

I love this chasing of the arrow,

and then his huge hand
across her head.

Love this gag.

Simple things make me laugh.

Again, just the amount of detail
in the flowers and the leaves,

the way the bush moves
when he grabs them there,

it's the kind of commitment
to attention to detail

that we were just very, very lucky

that people who had already
worn themselves out on <i>Antz</i>

were willing to jump back in.
When we started this movie,

they asked us
how difficult did we think it would be,

and we said,
"Five to 10 times that of <i>Antz,"</i>

and everyone fell off their chairs,
and then got back up

and just kind of launched into it.

And Aron probably had to deal
with them all trying to quit periodically.

I did, but I have to say that they
made this look almost easy, in a way,

and it wasn't, but their skill

really made it. The contact here,

when Shrek has to pick Donkey up,

you forget how difficult
this kind of stuff is.

The animators have to deal
with all the different contact points

of picking up Donkey and having him
flop on Shrek's shoulder,

and everything you'd just take
for granted is such a deal.

This was actually one of...

I think this might have been
the very last sequence

that we lit and animated,

and it was one that,
because it worked fine in storyboards,

we left it that way for the longest time,

and we knew that, coming back in,
it was many different environments,

something that we could kind of
break up a little bit more.

But it got to benefit from a lot of
the things we'd developed throughout,

like the grass moving
when they walked through it there,

the insects, the atmosphere.

We actually generated
a new type of tree for this sequence.

The effects artists developed
what they called a digital greenhouse,

where they could actually
grow these trees,

which is why they're able to get
so much variety within the trees.

This is one of my favorite jokes.

Yeah, no actual animals were injured
in the making of this film,

despite appearances.

But still, the balloons are happy.

As they float away, you can see
they're blinking. They're alive.

I love this gag, when they get
into a little shoving match.

It's just so cute.

Superhuman strength.
He shoves her into that bush.

See, they blink. It's okay.

It's what happens when they get
to 10,000 feet that I'm worried about,

and the air pressure goes down, and...

We're just enjoying it. Bear with us.

That line used to go a little bit further,
but we decided to cut it off there.

We had our first test screening
with a lot of kids and parents in it,

and we were surprised
at how uncomfortable we felt

with even stuff
that was pretty innocuous

from our experience,
but it just made us...

It made us cringe a little bit, so we... The criteria we were using at this point

was not so much,
"What would our children accept?"

'Cause we don't have children... 'Cause we don't have any.

But it was,
"What would our mothers accept?"

"What could we actually put in the movie
without getting into trouble?"

This is everyone's favorite,

little broken neck. It's a cute little Eddie moment.

In fact, mostly this scene is just in here
for this cute little Eddie moment.

"I think I need a hug."

This next sequence
was kind of challenging,

'cause we had a backlit situation

where we wanted enough fill light
and this very subtle kind of blue shadow

and very warm background behind,

and Mark Wendell and his team
did just a beautiful job

of capturing this very romantic
rim lighting on the characters,

in a scene when they're eating rat! Great animation in this sequence.

Yeah, I love
some of the facial expressions.

Yeah, some of the most subtle work
on Shrek,

when he's trying to ask Fiona
if she's seeing anybody.

A lot of that's Jason Reisig. Jason.

Don did some great stuff right here, too.

Yeah. Absolutely.

That was one of the first pieces

of more contemporary music
that we actually ever put in the film,

and we started playing around
with the idea of having music

that was a little unexpected
and was anachronistic

in the same way as much of our humor.

This is one of the first pieces
that we put in, and it just kind of stuck.

It stayed in there all the way through,

and we ultimately recorded it
with this band, Lifehouse.

This is when you realize
he could bite her head off.

Yes.

It's very sweet.

We're gonna go quiet
for a moment here.

We're all moved. Enjoy the sweet music.

Poor Shrek.

We fought about that,
adding that close-up on Shrek.

It was something
that Jeffrey wanted to do,

and we were convinced it wouldn't work,
and he was right. It worked. It was great.

That joke used to go on further.
He'd say,

"No, it's spinach I'm not afraid of."

It was really funny in the scratch version.
Somehow, it just lost its humor.

You know, you forget.
You see this movie so many times

when you're working on it that you forget
what's funny and what isn't.

You have to bring people in
to remind you,

"No, no, leave it
alone! It's a great joke!"

I like this little bit here where Shrek
is just playing with the stick there.

Whenever you can find a little thing
that a character would just normally do,

that a person would do
without thinking about,

it really brings the characters to life,

and I love it when the animators
find something like that,

and just giving him this prop
meant he could kind of use it in a way

that just feels very natural,

and just somehow makes him feel
a bit more human.

This is a really big moment for Shrek
in the movie,

and we really did not want
to hit it over the head,

but we wanted to make sure
that people got

that he's never made
any sort of commitment to anyone

in terms of how he felt about anything,
and it's very hard for him to do.

That's why that firewood shot
was so important.

There you go. That shot was in the movie,

out of the movie. We kept saying,
"But it's not a movie about firewood!"

Ultimately, the wood... Ultimately, it was.

Ultimately, the wood... Ultimately, it was.

The wood representation
was very strong.

The only insert shot

in the whole movie that we did! That's true. That's true.

This was an environment
where we first really pushed the idea

of kind of letting things fall away,

having more darkness,
kind of a smoky atmosphere,

and it was one of the ones
we did fairly early on.

We really wanted to establish a mood

with the design and the treatment
of the lighting in here.

Again, it's a limited palette.

It's mostly blue,
with just the orange of the firelight.

I think this was also Paul Wang,

our sequence supervisor. Right.

I love this one, where she is climbing up
out of the dust of the flour.

We did everything we could
to make her look as scary as possible,

with the ears and taking on,
sort of, a monster pose.

And a fantastic performance
from Eddie here.

It's sweet when she touches his cheek,
reminding him who she is,

and you forget
how difficult things like that are again.

It's the interaction
with the fingers and all that fur.

The music's really beautiful here. Yes, it's very pretty music.

The design of Fiona as an ogress
was really important,

that there was some commonality,
even though she looks very different,

she's obviously wearing the same dress
and the same hair and so on,

but we really worked hard

to make the eyes and eyebrows
be very, very similar,

so that when Donkey
looked into her eyes

or we looked into her eyes,
we could still see

that it was Princess Fiona inside there.

In the book,
there's a very different design for her.

We actually experimented quite a bit

before we landed
on this sweet, cherub face

that's very closely related to Shrek,
in that she's an ogre.

We took her hair,
made it a little more wild

than when she's in her princess form.

Just trying to find
that sweet earthiness about her,

like this is the way she was meant to be.

Even the choice
of her dress being green

was kind of a subconscious thing
we wanted to do,

to make you feel
that she belonged in Shrek's world.

So subconscious
I don't remember us discussing that.

Yeah, we did.

We had a great costume designer.
It was just like a live-action film.

You worked with her before, right? Isis Mussenden, yeah.

Isis is fantastic. She did a great job.

She sent us samples of fabric
for the wedding outfits and trim...

We all got to wear skirts
and dance around.

She didn't have to fit any actors,
so she was especially happy.

I love this little moment
with Donkey here.

This is a very funny ad-lib
that Eddie threw in,

and plus it's really where you just get
this real warmth from his voice.

It's amazing.

He's being very cruel, if you think
about it, but he's saying it so sweetly.

He doesn't mean anything by it.

And then this is some digital tears
coming up.

Her spell was an interesting problem,

trying to find the right way to explain
what was going on with her

without saying
that she was a beautiful princess

that had an "ugly curse" on her.

We actually wanted to play it
the other way around,

that maybe she was born an ogress
who had a "pretty curse" on her,

or a "pretty spell" on her.

This, to me,
is some of Mike's most natural improv,

where we really just gave him, again,
some sort of ideas of where to go

and the kind of things
that we wanted him to say,

and he just ran off a few different things,
and it meant it was very natural.

It really felt like he was struggling
to find the right words.

He totally got into
the moment of this, too.

Really. Very much.

This is actually a really big turning point
for Shrek right here,

and this is one of those bits of animation
where I still, after all this time,

just kind of forget
that Shrek is an animated character,

'cause he just seems so lifelike.

Cheung just did such an amazing job
with the face here,

where you just see Shrek
is completely crushed overhearing this,

and he's just such a person
at that moment.

It's great. Poor old Shrek.

It's kind of a story turning point
for us, too,

if I remember correctly,
sort of coming up with the idea

of him overhearing this
and misunderstanding.

It's true.
We used to have a big sequence

with Fiona and Shrek fighting.

He actually came back
and heard Donkey screaming

and, just in the shadows,
saw this creature

and chased her down and attacked her,

and then realized
that it was an ogress like himself,

and we couldn't quite get it to work,

and we used to have them
arguing the next day,

and it had an interesting dynamic,

but it didn't really get the story moving
in quite the way we wanted,

and one of the writers, Joe Stillman,
came upon this idea

of this misunderstanding,
where Shrek overhears something

and there's this complex, multiple level
of misunderstanding

where Shrek thinks she's rejecting him
and she thinks he's rejecting her,

and it just really is
one of those classic things,

I think, that happens in relationships,

where it just comes down
to one little moment.

This is real sweet. Another one
of those classic tragedies where,

just when she wants to fess up
and the two of them,

if they could just talk,
they could figure it all out.

Another beautiful music cue. Yes. Lovely music.

You'll notice in a couple of these shots
we played with things like lens flares.

It was kind of fun to add artifacts,

things that are accidental or mistakes
or artifacts of real film

that you actually use in CG to, again,
cue the audience

into a language they're familiar with.
People have seen so many movies,

and, 'cause we want them
to believe in this world,

if we use artifacts that are existent
in live-action movies,

people just kind of accept it,

and somehow it tricks them into thinking
that the world is real.

It's fun when Farquaad
comes riding over the hill

like the classic knight in shining armor.
It was a real trick getting armor on him,

to make him look,
as much as we could have,

the natural proportions of a regular guy.

We had to build these arms
that his own arms popped into,

and fake extendo-legs hanging down
on either side of the...

Didn't Catherine Yuh board this also? Yeah.

Beautiful. It totally cracked us up

when we saw the extendo-legs
for the first time.

And the way he's lifted out of the saddle
by his aides.

So he does kind of trick you there.

This sequence had to be
about the fastest going through lighting.

Susan did an amazing job
with the sequence,

because it was towards the end
and we were running out of time,

and yet it kind of had to be
this very beautiful morning light

where it's this sensitive,
romantic fairytale moment,

and I'm just amazed at how quickly

the lighters got through this sequence... Look at that.

And it is so beautiful. Excalibur.

Great bit of acting on Fiona
coming up here as well.

This is the extendo-legs. There we go. Yeah, this moment coming up,

where she looks to Shrek
for validation is, again,

one of those moments that you forget
that she's an animated character.

You see her look to him hopefully,

and then see her tense up
and her lips tighten. It's just beautiful.

Edip did a great job
with those close-ups.

I was really happy
with how we tried to do

as much with few words as possible. Yeah.

I think a lot of that's a real tribute...
This moment here. Here we go.

It's a real tribute to the animators. Yeah.

There's no dialogue there,
and yet you know exactly

what's going on in her head.

And then Shrek is devastated. A classic misunderstanding.

I love that moment just before there

when Donkey's trying
to get out of the shot, too.

He's backing up.
I was like, "Donkey, get out of the shot!"

"Get out of the shot!"

As if you're on the set,
silently gesturing to him.

This is fun. She magically flies up.

There was just a little moment
of independence there.

One of the things we always tried to do

was kind of make Fiona
a very independent woman,

and even though
she's offered assistance

up onto the horse there,
she just jumps up anyway.

I love the lighting in this sequence.

I really like the mood
and the atmosphere.

And I hate to admit it, but Mike made
us cry during the recording session.

He did. Mike was great here. Yeah, that was amazing on him.

You could hear the cry in his voice.
He was really moved.

It's devastating,
what he does to Donkey.

It's a sequence
where we have to divide everyone up,

off into their chosen fates,
and everyone's so upset.

Everyone except Farquaad, of course. I like the blush here.

We have tears welling up
in the characters' eyes,

which was something that, initially,
we were going to give up.

We just thought
it was a layer of difficulty

that we didn't really want to get into,

but again, the effects artists
came forward and said,

"Look, we think it's something
we can do."

So we were able to have characters
kind of welling up with tears, blushing,

those little moments
that we just notice in real humans.

We tried really hard to make
the transitions in here very smooth

from one character to the other,

especially relating Shrek's situation
to Fiona's situation,

realizing that they belong together
but they were separated.

Again, the use of music here,
I'm very, very happy with.

His voice, John Cale's voice,

just really conveys so much
of what Shrek's going through

in its very ironic tone.

I'm moved even now. I can't say a word. Our animation supervisor, Raman,

would never watch the movie
all the way through,

because he wanted to save it
till the last minute,

to actually get to see the whole story,
and he would only agree to watch it

if we didn't watch it in order.

But he would always cry
in this sequence.

It chokes people up. A lot of people.

It was really effective,
even in storyboard form.

I know I cried at many times
during the making of this movie,

but it usually wasn't the content

of the movie! You weren't moved.

It was 'cause I was yelling at you.

This is one of my favorite little gags
in the movie, too.

Now, we're not disparaging
short people. Farquaad has issues.

He just can't recognize that,
of everyone he's kicking out,

he would consider himself part of them,
but he's got blinders on.

It's his own form of denial.

There's a lot of use of reflection
in this sequence,

which was kind of a deliberate idea,

that the characters had a moment
to reflect on themselves,

but again, it was just one of those things
that in computer graphics is achievable,

and just adds this whole
extra dimension to the sequence.

There was a whole sequence
at one time of Donkey...

Confronting. That's right.

Talking to his own reflection,

and his reflection talking him
into going to Shrek

and yelling at him
and stand up for himself.

There's some wonderful
Eddie performance, too,

yelling at the Dragon.
"Chill with the groveling."

So this is now Donkey
coming into his own,

So this is now Donkey
coming into his own,

finally, for the first time,
standing up for himself

and telling Shrek what he really thinks.

They really...
You know that they're friends,

and Donkey
is just standing up for himself,

but it's under the guise of this argument,

but actually he's come back
to live on Shrek's land with him.

This is fun.

I love this little tussle they have.

It used to be "a big-ass rock."
We had many, many ass jokes in this,

and I think collectively our crew
just talked us into it.

One day they counted them up,
and I think we had something like 12,

so we lost all of the ones
that didn't just work on the principle

that it's a pun for donkey.

This scene was a really difficult scene.

In writing, we used to actually
have this sequence

where Shrek was arrested
and thrown in jail,

and the reason that ultimately Donkey
actually held something over him

was that he managed
to steal the key to the cell,

and he was gonna use that
to get Shrek out of there,

and once we got rid of the idea
of Shrek being captured,

we didn't really have anything
that Donkey could hold over Shrek.

And then we realized that instead
of actually having a physical thing

that he could hold over him,
he had this information about Fiona.

He knew what Fiona
really thought of Shrek,

and that was something
that was of great value to Shrek,

so he could get the apology out of Shrek
by holding that over him.

He also knows what Fiona really is. Exactly.

You know, internal motivations
always turned out to be

the best way to go with Shrek,
from getting him out of his swamp,

not because
he couldn't live there any more,

it's because he didn't want to

when he was surrounded
by all those annoying characters.

It's the same case here.
It just works more from the heart.

I think coming up here
is another lovely little bit

of sensitive facial animation on Shrek.

We're all just enjoying it together.

There's a moment that Anthony did
there that was just really lovely.

Again, just those little looks away,
it just really works, I think, very...

Just that look away, you really know
that he's kind of thinking.

Bringing the Dragon back
was so much fun.

It was just one
of those classic moments

that kids just wish they...

I think all of us just wish we had
a pet dragon when we were kids,

and we'd just jump on it after school
and escape.

I did actually have a pet dragon as a kid.

That's right. They occur naturally
in New Zealand, don't they?

You know,
you can't import them anymore.

They've banned that.
They're hard to breed.

There she is.

In this, we actually looked
at a sequence from <i>True Lies,</i>

when the Hawker Harrier lands,

and we were really going
for that big action moment,

but with a dragon. The trees and the grass

and everything in this sequence
are so beautiful...

The leaves blowing around. That Janet supervised.

And this bit of score is just beautiful.
It's kind of like the main theme

again coming through,
but this time in a very...

Just lifts your soul. Exalting... Yeah.

I love that shadow of the dragon
down there on the ground.

Shows you just how high up they are.

Those kind of details were really fun
to keep track of,

just to give everything
that extra bit of magic.

Just to give everything
that extra bit of magic.

I think, actually, the really good thing

about that big uplifting score there
is that,

if you're still listening to this
directors'-producers' commentary,

it'll wake you up again.
It's really useful in that way.

I love the signs. I love that gag.

We had them in the tournament as well.
It's just a little running gag.

It's just a little reminder
of how much control Farquaad has

over his environment, all his people.

It's a very totalitarianistic kind of rule
that he has.

The people are so docile.

They just sort of go
with whoever's the leader now.

Once Farquaad is eaten,
they just seem to accept it all,

but we figured if we added those
little touches showing his dominance,

that that would be enough
to let you know

that maybe it wasn't such a good idea
that he was the ruler.

This is another Conrad moment
coming up here where...

He just pitched this idea to us.

He just went off and developed it,
and just had us in tears.

At times we were tempted to cut it,
'cause it's quite a distraction.

I mean, really, it's time they just got on
with the rescue bit.

There's just two funny moments here
that are totally worth it for the humor.

It is so classic Donkey,

because he just wants to sing
and belt it out.

I love this one. This is a great gag,

with Donkey being thrown up
to check on the situation inside.

The difficult thing sometimes
in a comedy where you've got a story,

you've got the humor,
you've got a theme,

and you've gotta kind of
play the balance between them,

and the temptation
to get on with the story

at the cost of comedy
is sometimes very tempting,

and in this case we really thought,

"No, let's just play out the humor.
We'll get to the big moment soon."

I think it keeps the story
from becoming too heavy-handed, too.

Great ad-libbing there from Mike.

That ad-lib was actually
for a different sequence.

At one stage that was actually
for the tournament,

and it didn't really fit in there any more,
and when we came to this sequence,

we needed this kind of moment
when Shrek was walking in,

and there was nothing there
that really gave it a little punch,

and we sort of remembered
this ad-lib that Mike had done

and put it in there,
and it just worked a treat.

It dealt with his discomfort
at being in this situation, too.

Tricky sequence.
I remember boarding this one ages ago.

It's always hard to do
a three-way conversation

to know who's looking where,
and screen direction,

and this was real tricky.

This sequence is actually
two-and-a-half sequences shot-wise,

as Jane, the associate producer,
kept saying,

"It's not one sequence, guys."

Typically, the end of your movie

is something that you work
over and over and over again,

trying to hit all the right details.

When does she transform?
When does Shrek come in?

How much of a participant is he
in her rescue?

We found that,
even if he just whistled for the dragon,

it turned out that that was enough
to make him active enough

in turning the situation around.

John was great in this sequence, too.
John Lithgow is just amazing.

And this next part coming up, again,

with the very organic,
magical kind of effects,

was very challenging
for the effects artists.

We needed something that was
dynamic and yet ethereal and beautiful,

and it was a very difficult kind of effect
to develop.

I love that faint.

A generic.
We call all our crowd people "generics."

If you look in the crowd,
you can find people that you know.

It's a little challenge
we had all the way through.

One of the Merry Men
was definitely one of our...

Story guys. Effects supervisors. No, Monty.

Monty. Yeah, he's doing the Macarena

at the end. Yes.

And our Friar Tuck is Vern Kramerson. I love that piece with Farquaad there.

It's a beautiful piece of animation.
Really nice lighting.

This was a real trick. All of these guards
grabbing hold of Shrek,

all the contact and pulling
and pushing back and forth.

The other challenge we had
in this sequence

was the continual changing of light,
as we start just before sunset,

and by the end of the sequence
the sun has set,

and we wanted to get
this gradual shift of light

throughout the sequence,
which made it quite challenging.

Beautiful windows.

Again, the graphic work
from our art department,

Julia, especially.

Everyone's favorite Donkey line.

And that burp
was actually our music editor.

Not treated in any way.
He actually burps like that.

Very sweet work
on the two of these characters here.

We're just enjoying it.
Give us a moment.

We actually...
When we're recording these sequences,

we record with the actors separately,

and when we were recording this
with Mike,

we actually asked him
to bring in his wife, Robin,

and he actually recorded this
with her reading against him,

and I think it just gave him
a very genuine kind of sense.

Again, these are very difficult effects.

It's amazing that it all comes together
and it just looks beautiful,

when you consider the hours
and sweat and blood

that actually went into
every little smoke particle here.

Made no less difficult
by your incredible perfectionism

during the course of production there.
But it all worked out well.

Fabulous details,
blowing out the windows.

The gag of when the dragon
actually pops out the window

we tried in a few different places.
It's so fun.

There are times you find even,
as dramatic as a moment is,

you still need to have
a little bit of comic relief,

and the audience is almost thankful
because they're enjoying the moment,

as sentimental as it is,
but they don't mind...

It's a treacle cutter. It's a treacle cutter,

and it's also
a little bit of a stress release.

I always felt like we should have left that
a little bit longer

before she spoke then. Yeah.

It still bugs me to this day.
She just talks just a moment too soon.

Yeah, like she was unconscious
while she was on the ground.

I know.

I know.

Good fun here at the end.

Yeah, Smash Mouth did a great job
of redoing this song.

The song we put in very early on,

'cause just thematically,
it was just so perfect

for what was going on with Shrek,

and then Smash Mouth
were nice enough to redo it for us.

Pinocchio's dance.

Pinocchio's dance! That's our editor, Sim.

Sim did this dance in his chair
and inspired everyone.

We all just fell over laughing.

Another little note,
the movie ended just about here,

when they rode off into the sunset
and the book closed,

and it was very sweet
and it was a happy ending,

but it wasn't a big laugh,

so cutting back to Donkey
starting to do the <i>I'm a Believer</i>

as if it was after the wedding,
at the reception, in karaoke style,

really just brought the movie,
you know, out the door laughing.

It was amazing
having both Jeffrey Katzenberg

and Steven Spielberg
to give us advice throughout this,

and Jeffrey was definitely a big advocate
of going out with a big laugh.

And I have to admit,
I think we all questioned having to do it,

and it worked incredibly well.
It was a pretty brilliant stroke.

And to be able to see
the fairytale characters again, too,

'cause we'd seen them all
in the beginning.

We had toyed with using them more.
Early on we thought maybe

they helped out with the rescue
of Fiona, that sort of thing,

but here we got a sense of them
all playing together and dancing.

Right when we were about
to finish the movie,

it's amazing that we decided to do this,
and Aron figured out that we could do it,

and they were okay with spending
the money to do it, which was fantastic.

Once again, a record time, though,
that we put the sequence together.

And Eddie, we had to go and ask him,

"Can you please
sing badly for us again?"

He sounds good, though.

He does,
but he actually has an amazing voice,

and to get him to sing like Donkey,
I think, was kind of challenging for him.

And then we go to the storybook ending.

"And they lived ugly ever after."

So if you're still listening,

you've made it all the way through
to the end of the movie,

and believe me,
it was actually a lot more fun making it

than it was listening to us
talking about making it.

Next, here we have a very long list
of all the people

we have to be very, very grateful to
for really making this movie...

Without any one of them,
none of this would have been possible.

They also did make it fun. Yeah.

It was an incredibly fun and heartfelt... It was a lot of fun.

Wonderful, warm group of people.

I think everyone realizes
what a special experience it was.

In fact, I'm sure most of the people
listening to this commentary

will probably be the people
that worked on the movie,

so as you see your name come up,

please put a "thank you"
before your name.

And "applause" afterwards.

'Cause we really do
want to thank everyone

for just making this experience
so wonderful for us,

and just producing a movie
that I think we're very proud of.
